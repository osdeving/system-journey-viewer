Chronological engineering log. Entries are kept concise and focused on behavior and validation.

## 2026-02-16 - README demo disclaimer and Vercel build/output fixes

### Scope

- Improve README clarity for demo media quality expectations.
- Add static UI reference image.

  - added visible warning that robot-captured demo may show temporary UI misalignment;
  - added static screenshot section using `docs/print-ui.png`;
  - updated Vercel output directory instructions to `dist`.
- Build/deploy pipeline updates:
  - added `scripts/prepare-root-dist.mjs` to copy `apps/web/dist` to root `dist`;
  - updated root `build` script to run web build and then mirror output to root `dist`;
  - updated `vercel.json` to `outputDirectory: \"dist\"`.
- Bundle/chunk updates:
  - lazy-loaded Monaco editor in `apps/web/src/App.tsx`;
  - added manual chunk strategy and raised chunk warning threshold in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`.

### Validation

- `npm run lint`
