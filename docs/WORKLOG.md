### Validation

- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run lint`
- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run test:run`
- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run build`

## 2026-02-16 - Animated export and player timing refinements

### Highlights

- Added animated export support for GIF, MP4, and animated SVG.
- Ensured full-journey loop capture and slower, more readable playback pacing.
- Aligned trail composition to rendered geometry and viewport transforms.
- Added trail toggle while preserving moving orb rendering.

### Validation

- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run lint`
- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run test:run`
- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run build`

## 2026-02-15 - UI polish, dockable workflows, Monaco DSL editor

### Highlights

- Introduced desktop-style menubar behavior and dock controls.
- Added `JourneyScript` naming and Monaco syntax highlighting.

### Validation

- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run lint`
- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run test:run`
- `npm --workspace @sjv/web run build`

## 2026-02-12 to 2026-02-14 - Foundation milestones (M0 to M9)

### Highlights

- Added static export (SVG/PNG/PDF).
- Added Codex gateway integration for DSL assistance.

### Validation

- Iterative lint/test/build checks per milestone branch.
